# Azure Function + Stripe Subscriptions

Currently this is just the Function on its own, focused on Subscriptions. 

*Still needs to be refactored*


# Getting Started

Add your `secret` API Key in the `stripe.js` file.

Press F5 to run and debug locally.

Use Postman (or Chrome for GET requests), alternatively create a front-end app.

I will add a sample frontend at some point.
